        <strong>Jazz Music üé∑</strong><br>
        I love listening to jazz music - there's something magical about the improvisation and complexity. 
        Currently exploring the works of Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Bill Evans. The mathematical 
        patterns in jazz harmonies somehow resonate with the algorithmic thinking in my research work.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>Favorite Albums:</strong><br>
        ‚Ä¢ Kind of Blue - Miles Davis<br>
        ‚Ä¢ A Love Supreme - John Coltrane<br>
        ‚Ä¢ Waltz for Debby - Bill Evans Trio<br>
        ‚Ä¢ Time Out - Dave Brubeck Quartet
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>Random Facts Collection üìö</strong><br>
        I have an obsession with collecting random, interesting facts. Did you know that graph theory 
        was invented by Leonhard Euler to solve the Seven Bridges of K√∂nigsberg problem? Or that the 
        human brain has approximately 86 billion neurons, roughly the same order of magnitude as the 
        number of stars in the Milky Way? I find these connections fascinating!

        <strong>Singapore üá∏üá¨ (ICLR 2025)</strong><br>
        ICLR 2025 in Singapore was an incredible experience! Gardens by the Bay provided the perfect 
        backdrop for evening strolls where conversations about neural architecture search continued 
        under the towering Supertrees. The marriage of technology and nature felt symbolic of the 
        conference itself.
        
        <br><br>
        Sentosa Island offered a welcome respite from intense technical discussions. Beach walks with 
        <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=samyak_id" target="_blank">Samyak Jain</a> 
        turned into impromptu whiteboard sessions in the sand, sketching graph structures and discussing 
        the future of AI research.
        
        <br><br>
        Late-night walks through Singapore's immaculate streets with 
        <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mridul_id" target="_blank">Mridul Gupta</a> 
        became a cherished ritual. We'd recap the day's highlights and often lose track of time discussing 
        everything from transformer architectures to the philosophical implications of AGI. 
        (Yes, I lost my debit card during one of these adventures, but the memories far outweighed the inconvenience!)

        <strong>Pittsburgh üá∫üá∏ (Carnegie Mellon Summer)</strong><br>
        My summer at CMU was the most amazing cultural experience of my life! From thrilling rides at 
        <a href="https://www.kennywood.com/" target="_blank">Kennywood</a> to late nights in Millvale, 
        Pittsburgh gave me a glimpse into American life. The city's blend of industrial heritage and 
        cutting-edge technology research perfectly embodies the spirit of computer science innovation.
        
        <br><br>
        Working at the heart of ML research while exploring the Steel City's neighborhoods, trying 
        Primanti Brothers sandwiches, and understanding why they say "My heart is in the work" 
        (Carnegie's motto) made this summer truly special.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>Copenhagen üá©üá∞ (Research Visit)</strong><br>
        My research visit to the University of Copenhagen was both academically enriching and culturally 
        eye-opening. The Danish approach to work-life balance provided a refreshing perspective on research. 
        Cycling through the city's bike-friendly streets while pondering high-dimensional search algorithms 
        was uniquely Copenhagen!
        
        <br><br>
        The Danish Data Science Academy's support made this collaboration possible, and working with 
        <a href="https://di.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/467373" target="_blank">Dr. Panagiotis Karras</a> 
        on spatial databases opened new research horizons.

        <strong>Current Mood: Quizzes and Academics üòÖ</strong><br>
        Right now, I'm just trying to work my way through quizzes and academics. :3 
        The life of an undergraduate researcher involves a delicate balance between coursework, 
        research deadlines, and conference submissions. Sometimes I wonder how I manage to juggle 
        graph neural networks, molecular chemistry, and linear algebra problem sets all at once!
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>Research Philosophy</strong><br>
        I believe that the best research happens at the intersection of disciplines. My journey from 
        molecular solubility prediction to graph distillation to high-dimensional search algorithms 
        reflects this philosophy. Each field informs the others - the mathematical rigor from chemistry, 
        the algorithmic thinking from computer science, and the statistical foundations from machine learning.
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>Learning Mindset</strong><br>
        Every conversation with researchers like 
        <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UZ5wscMAAAAJ" target="_blank">Prof. Michael Bronstein</a>, 
        <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pradeepr/" target="_blank">Prof. Pradeep Ravikumar</a>, and 
        <a href="https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~sayan/" target="_blank">Dr. Sayan Ranu</a> teaches me something new. 
        I try to approach every problem with curiosity and humility - there's always more to learn!

        <strong>Favorite Programming Languages</strong><br>
        ‚Ä¢ <strong>Python:</strong> My go-to for research - PyTorch, NetworkX, and scientific computing<br>
        ‚Ä¢ <strong>OCaml:</strong> Appreciate its functional programming elegance and type safety<br>
        ‚Ä¢ <strong>C++:</strong> For performance-critical algorithms and systems programming
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>Research Tools I Love</strong><br>
        ‚Ä¢ <strong>PyTorch Geometric:</strong> Perfect for graph neural network research<br>
        ‚Ä¢ <strong>RDKit:</strong> Essential for molecular informatics and chemical property prediction<br>
        ‚Ä¢ <strong>Jupyter Notebooks:</strong> Great for exploratory data analysis and visualization<br>
        ‚Ä¢ <strong>LaTeX:</strong> Nothing beats it for mathematical typesetting in papers
        
        <br><br>
        <strong>Development Setup</strong><br>
        I'm a Linux enthusiast who appreciates the flexibility and control it provides for research computing. 
        My typical workflow involves Vim for quick edits, VS Code for larger projects, and terminal multiplexers 
        for managing multiple experiments. Cloud computing platforms like AWS and Google Colab have been 
        invaluable for scaling up experiments.
