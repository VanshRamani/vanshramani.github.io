About me
I'm an undergraduate in Computer Science Engineering at IIT Delhi with a deep interest in Artificial Intelligence and its applications. My work spans graph deep learning, spatio-temporal data analytics, data distillation, and high-dimensional nearest neighbor search. Recently, I've been exploring LLMs and agentic frameworks. 

I love reading random facts, listening to jazz music, and right now, I'm just trying to work my way through quizzes and academics. :3

Projects
XG-TREE: Decision Tree-GNN Hybrid Architecture with XGBoost
Currently developing an advanced machine learning model that integrates the TREE-G architecture with XGBoost's gradient boosting framework. This integration aims to use the strengths of both approaches: TREE-G's hierarchical tree structures and XGBoost's efficient gradient boosting algorithms. By combining these methodologies, we anticipate enhanced predictive performance and faster convergence rates, particularly in complex datasets where traditional models may struggle.

Erudite: Agentic Knowledge Graph System
Developed a multi-agent RAG pipeline for dynamic expanding knowledge graphs integrating 5+ sources (Semantic Scholar/YouTube) using Claude Haiku, achieving interactive graph generation in 130s. Designed fault-tolerant architecture with parallel agent execution (3 retries + exponential backoff) and modular templates for new data sources.

Panorama: Scalable Nearest Neighbor Search In High Dimensions
Designed Panorama, an exact k-nearest neighbor search algorithm that mitigates the curse of dimensionality via DCT energy compaction and Cauchy-Schwarz bounds. It achieves O(n log d) query complexity by progressively pruning distance computations in high-dimensional spaces (d ≈ 106 ), demonstrating a 10× speedup over ANNOY, HNSW baselines on image classification and location-based service datasets. Extended to Panorama Parallel with a shared memory architecture for linear scalability (achieving over k-fold speedup with k workers), particularly effective for transient data in machine learning distillation pipelines.

Bonsai: Model Agnostic Graph Condensation
Created Bonsai, a model-agnostic graph condensation framework through Weisfeiler-Lehman Kernel-based exemplar trees, achieving 14/18 SOTA results (+5% accuracy) across 7 real-world datasets. The gradient-free method condenses graphs in O(n) time by selecting maximally representative computation trees, outperforming GCOND/GDEM/GCSR etc on billion-edge graphs while being 22× faster than gradient-based approaches and being architecture independant, enabling direct reuse across GAT/GCN/GraphSAGE without recondensing.
